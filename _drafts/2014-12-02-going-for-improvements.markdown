I have been looking for points of improvements in this blog, some ideas I had and some I have implemented:

* Google Analytics: lets see if there is a single access to my blog from the outside world. (Already in place)
* Comments for people outside (Missing)
* Add contact details with Social Media (FB, LinkedIn, etc) (Missing)
* Blog Arquive? Links for older content? (Missing)
* Add my CV? (Missing)

I will try to keep this updated, and hopefully I can create a Guide of "How to Add feature X" on GitHub pages blogs.
