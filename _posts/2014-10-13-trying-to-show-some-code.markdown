I would really like to go to [Hacker School][1]. I think it is a life experience which may add a lot to me, but I do not know where to start to get there.

I am currently working for a large company, but I cannot disclose code I write there. I think this can slow me down on the selection process. Therefore this post has two intents, first to announce that I will try to apply for Hacker School, and the second is that I am planning to write a simple game here in Github so it can be seen by others.

The game will probably not be big thing, first of all it will be the first game I will ever write. I will think on what I can do and then post it here.

My first thought is the hackerschool suggestion of a tic-tac-toe. Let's go for it!

Wish me good luck!
