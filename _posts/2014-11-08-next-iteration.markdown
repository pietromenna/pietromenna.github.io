I started coding in a very iterative way, I can say until now there were two sessions of 1 hour or so each.  During each interaction, first I wrote some test code (using an xUnit like framework called [Qunit][1]), and then wrote some "productive code". 

In some cases, I skipped the sequence: wrote first code, then the test code. But in the iteraction I will try to stick to red-green-refactor.

Until now, all code written is useless: none other than the tests can use it.

In order to fix this, next iteraction of code will be different. I will do some HTML and the UI. A quick mock up can be seen in the image below:

Now, back about the code: I am not really happy with the code I have, some refactors may be needed. Luckily I have written tests which will ensure everything keeps working.

Good luck to me!
