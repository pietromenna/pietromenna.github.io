Browsing through the internet we can realize some good guides for Jekyll blogs. Some of them contain really good ideas:

* Adding comments capabilities (Be able to form a community and receive feedback)
* Adding Google Analytics (Know how is visiting you)
* Adding Social Media Sharing Capabilities (Facebook Like, Twitter, etc)
* Constructing an Archive from Jekyll (Better navigation for users)

A great guide can be found [here][1]. In this guide, [Joshua][2] breifly describes how to add comments by using [Disqus][3], how to create the archive page, how to add Google Analytics, and at last how integrate with Twitter.

I will do some adjustments to this blog using this guide and latter on comment on it. There are other guides on the Internet, I read some others but I found this [one][1] to be the most straight to the point.

**Update** I followed the guide and all which was commented is now on the site and working.
