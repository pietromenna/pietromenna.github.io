Today my seventh day at [Recurse Center][1] is over. The idea of this postis to reflect what happened from 3rd day until today.

Many of the thinks I have said before I would have liked doing at the begining of RC I haven't even touched: for example: I did not solve any other [Euler Project][2] problem, did not work on [Eudyptula Challenge][3] and haven't participated in any Social Events.

My third and fourth day I spent trying to understand Functional Programming and to about [Clojure][4]. *Without success.* I got stuck many times. 

**Getting Stuck seems to be the way of learning that there is some basic knowledge missing** to continue the current task. I learnt during these days that in order to advance, I must be humble and **ask for help**. 

This week was way better. I had the change to pair with a [colleague][7] that already knew Function Programming, just not Clojure. Luckily for me he wanted also to learn Clojure, so we went through [4clojure][5] together. I am really glad because it unlocked many of the problems I was experiecing. He was very patient to explain even the basics to me.

After pairing with my colleague, Clojure started flowing a lot better. I also started following a MOOC called [Functional Programming in Clojure][6], I strongly recommend it if you would like to learn Clojure.

Anyway, I think this will be the last post about myself at Recurse Center. I plan to start blogging in a different fashion from now on. I hope to see you in my next post, which will be available shortly. It will be about **Functional Programming**.
