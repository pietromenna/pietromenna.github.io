It is amazing how to find time to do something is really scarce when you have a child! I could not use my computer in like 6 days.

I tried to start the course at [Codecademy][1] for Javascript on the 13th this month, but could only start it today. Anyway, I found it very basic and I think it will take some time to finish it.

I think I should start thinking on how to do the tic-tac-toe. Here is my plan:

Now, I have been thinking on what would be the issues I would have:

* First would be to identify the region the user clicked, but this can also be solved using the simpler solution of just using plain html buttons and it's events.
* Second problem: identify when someone has won the game.
* Shall I implement the AI?
* Shall I try Unit Testing?

Well, I shall better continue reading about JS! 

Cheers!

**29-10-2014 Update:** Started actually doing the Codeacademy course. Only could do 25% so far.

**31-10-2014 Update:** Continuing the CodeCademy course. It is very slow, but education wise seems good! (65 %) I hope I get to finish it in this weekend!

**03-11-2014 Update:** Finished the course on CodeCademy! 

**04-11-2014 Update:** Started the repo, meanwhile not in [GitHub][2], but in [BitBucket][3]. Check it [here][4].

**05-11-2014 Update:** Still no GUI. Let's think about it for a minute, and then try to put into the next post!
